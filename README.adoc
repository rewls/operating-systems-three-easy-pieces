== Preface

=== To Everyone

* The book is called *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* (available at
  `http://ostep.org`), and the title is obviously an homage to one of the
  greatest sets of lecture notes ever created, by one Richard Feynman on the
  topic of Physics [F96].
* While this book will undoubtedly fall short of the high standard set by that
  famous physicist, perhaps it will be good enough for you in your quest to
  understand what operating systems (and more generally, systems) are all
  about.

'''

* The three easy pieces refer to the three major thematic elements the book is
  organized around: *virtualization*, *concurrency*, and *persistence*.
* In discussing these concepts, we'll end up discussing most of the important
  things an operating system does; hopefully, you'll also have some fun along
  the way.

'''

* Each major concept is divided into a set of chapters, most of which present a
  particular problem and then show how to solve it.
* The chapters are short, and try (as best as possible) to reference the source
  material where the ideas really came from.
* One of our goals in writing this book is to make the paths of history as
  clear as possible, as we think that helps a student understand what is, what
  was, and what will be more clearly.

'''

* There are a couple devices we use throughout the book which are probably
  worth introducing here.
* The first is the *crux* of the problem.
* Anytime we are trying to solve a problem, we first try to state what the most
  important issue is; such a *crux of the problem* is explicitly called out
  in the text, and hopefully solved via the techniques, algorithms, and ideas
  presented in the rest of the text.
* In many places, we'll explain how a system works by showing its behavior over
  time.
* These *timelines* are at the essence of understanding; if you know what
  happens, for example, when a process page faults, you are on your way to
  truly understanding how virtual memory operates.
* If you comprehend what takes place when a journaling file system writes a
  block to disk, you have taken the first steps towards mastery of storage
  systems.

'''

* There are also numerous *asides* and *tips* throughout the text, adding a
  little color to the mainline presentation.
* Asides tend to discuss something relevant (but perhaps not essential) to the
  main text; tips tend to be general lessons that can be applied to systems you
  build.
* An index at the end of the book lists all of these tips and asides (as well
  as cruces, the odd plural of crux) for your convenience.

'''

* We use one of the oldest didactic methods, the *dialogue*, throughout the
  book, as a way of presenting some of the material in a different light.
* These are used to introduce the major thematic concepts (in a peachy way, as
  we will see), as well as to review material every now and then.
* They are also a chance to write in a more humorous style.
* Whether you find them useful, or humorous, well, that's another matter
  entirely.

'''

* At the beginning of each major section, we'll first present an
  *abstraction* that an operating system provides, and then work in subsequent
  chapters on the mechanisms, policies, and other support needed to
  provide the abstraction.
* Abstractions are fundamental to all aspects of Computer Science, so it is
  perhaps no surprise that they are also essential in operating systems.

'''

* Throughout the chapters, we try to use *real code* (not *pseudocode*) where
  possible, so for virtually all examples, you should be able to type
  them up yourself and run them.
* Running real code on real systems is the best way to learn about operating
  systems, so we encourage you to do so when you can.
* We are also making code available for your viewing
  pleasurefootnote:[https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code].

'''

* In various parts of the text, we have sprinkled in a few *homeworks* to
  ensure that you are understanding what is going on.
* Many of these homeworks are little *simulations* of pieces of the operating
  system; you should download the homeworks, and run them to quiz yourself.
* The homework simulators have the following feature: by giving them a
  different random seed, you can generate a virtually infinite set of problems;
  the simulators can also be told to solve the problems for you.
* Thus, you can test and re-test yourself until you have achieved a good level
  of understanding.

'''

* The most important addendum to this book is a set of *projects* in which you
  learn about how real systems work by designing, implementing, and testing
  your own code.
* All projects (as well as the code examples, mentioned above) are in the *C
  programming language* [KR88]; C is a simple and powerful language that
  underlies most operating systems, and thus worth adding to your tool-chest of
  languages.
* Two types of projects are available (see the online appendix for ideas).
* The first type is systems programming projects; these projects are great for
  those who are new to C and UNIX and want to learn how to do low-level C
  programming.
* The second type is based on a real operating system kernel developed at MIT
  called xv6 [CK+08]; these projects are great for students that already have
  some C and want to get their hands dirty inside the OS.
* At Wisconsin, we've run the course in three different ways: either all
  systems programming, all xv6 programming, or a mix of both.

'''

* We are slowly making project descriptions, and a testing framework,
  available.
* See our
  repositoryfootnote:[https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects]
  for more information.
* If not part of a class, this will give you a chance to do these projects on
  your own, to better learn the material.
* Unfortunately, you don't have a TA to bug when you get stuck, but not
  everything in life can be free (but books can be!).

=== To Educators

* The course divides fairly well across a 15-week semester, in which you can
  cover most of the topics within at a reasonable level of depth.
* Cramming the course into a 10-week quarter probably requires dropping some
  detail from each of the pieces.
* There are also a few chapters on virtual machine monitors, which we usually
  squeeze in sometime during the semester, either right at end of the large
  section on virtualization, or near the end as an aside.

'''

* One slightly unusual aspect of the book is that concurrency, a topic at the
  front of many OS books, is pushed off herein until the student has built an
  understanding of virtualization of the CPU and of memory.
* In our experience in teaching this course for nearly 20 years, students have
  a hard time understanding how the concurrency problem arises, or why they are
  trying to solve it, if they don't yet understand what an address space is, what
  a process is, or why context switches can occur at arbitrary points in time.
* Once they do understand these concepts, however, introducing the notion of
  threads and the problems that arise due to them becomes rather easy, or at
  least, easier.

'''

* As much as is possible, we use a chalkboard (or whiteboard) to deliver a
  lecture.
* On these more conceptual days, we come to class with a few major ideas and
  examples in mind and use the board to present them.
* Handouts are useful to give the students concrete problems to solve based on
  the material.
* On more practical days, we simply plug a laptop into the projector and show
  real code; this style works particularly well for concurrency lectures as
  well as for any discussion sections where you show students code that is
  relevant for their projects.
* We don't generally use slides to present material, but have now made a set
  available for those who prefer that style of presentation.

'''

* One last request: if you use the free online chapters, please just link to
  them, instead of making a local copy.
* This helps us track usage (million of chapters downloaded each month) and
  also ensures students get the latest (and greatest?) version.

=== To Students

* We both think back fondly towards some textbooks of our undergraduate days
  (e.g., Hennessy and Patterson [HP90], the classic book on computer
  architecture) and hope this book will become one of those positive memories for
  you.

'''

* You may have noticed this book is free and available online.
* There is one major reason for this: textbooks are generally too expensive.
* This book, we hope, is the first of a new wave of free materials to help
  those in pursuit of their education, regardless of which part of the world
  they come from or how much they are willing to spend for a book.
* Failing that, it is one free book, which is better than none.

'''

* We also hope, where possible, to point you to the original sources of much of
  the material in the book: the great papers and persons who have shaped the
  field of operating systems over the years.
* Ideas are not pulled out of the air; they come from smart and hard-working
  people (including numerous Turing-award winners), and thus we should strive
  to celebrate those ideas and people where possible.
* In doing so, we hopefully can better understand the revolutions that have
  taken place, instead of writing texts as if those thoughts have always been
  present [K62].
* Further, perhaps such references will encourage you to dig deeper on your
  own; reading the famous papers of our field is certainly one of the best ways
  to learn.

=== Final Words

* Yeats famously said "Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting
  of a fire."
* He was right but wrong at the same time.
* You do have to "fill the pail" a bit, and these notes are certainly here to
  help with that part of your education; after all, when you go to interview at
  Google, and they ask you a trick question about how to use semaphores, it might
  be good to actually know what a semaphore is, right?

'''

* But Yeats's larger point is obviously on the mark: the real point of
  education is to get you interested in something, to learn something more
  about the subject matter on your own and not just what you have to digest to
  get a good grade in some class.

'''

* We created these notes to spark your interest in operating systems, to read
  more about the topic on your own, to talk to your professor about all the
  exciting research that is going on in the field, and even to get involved
  with that research.
* It is a great field(!), full of exciting and wonderful ideas that have shaped
  computing history in profound and important ways.
* And while we understand this fire won't light for all of you, we hope it does
  for many, or even a few.
* Because once that fire is lit, well, that is when you truly become capable of
  doing something great.
* And thus the real point of the educational process: to go forth, to study
  many new and fascinating topics, to learn, to mature, and most importantly,
  to find something that lights a fire for you.
