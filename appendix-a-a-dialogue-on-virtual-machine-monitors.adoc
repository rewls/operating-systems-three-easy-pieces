= A Dialogue on Virtual Machine Monitors

Student::
So now we're stuck in the Appendix, huh?

Professor::
Yes, just when you thought things couldn't get any worse.

Student::
Well, what are we going to talk about?

Professor::
An old topic that has been reborn: *virtual machine monitors*, also known as
*hypervisors*.

Student::
Oh, like VMware? +
That's cool; I've used that kind of software before.

Professor::
Cool indeed. +
We'll learn how VMMs add yet another layer of virtualization into systems,
this one beneath the OS itself! +
Crazy and amazing stuff, really.

Student::
Sounds neat. +
Why not include this in the earlier part of the book, then, on
virtualization? +
Shouldn't it really go there?

Professor::
That's above our pay grade, I'm afraid. +
But my guess is this: there is already a lot of material there. +
By moving this small aside on VMMs into the appendix, a particular instructor
can choose whether to include it or skip it. +
But I do think it should be included, because if you can understand how VMMs
work, then you really understand virtualization quite well.

Student::
Alright then, let's get to work!
