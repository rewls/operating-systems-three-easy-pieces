= 4 The Abstraction: The Process
:figure-caption: Figure 4.
:imagesdir: images
:toc: left

* In this chapter, we discuss one of the most fundamental abstractions that
  the OS provides to users: the *process*.
* The definition of a process, informally, is quite simple: it is a running
  program [V+65,BH70].
* The program itself is a lifeless thing: it just sits there on the disk, a
  bunch of instructions (and maybe some static data), waiting to spring into
  action.
* It is the operating system that takes these bytes and gets them running,
  transforming the program into something useful.

'''

* It turns out that one often wants to run more than one program at once; for
  example, consider your desktop or laptop where you might like to run a web
  browser, mail program, a game, a music player, and so forth.
* In fact, a typical system may be seemingly running tens or even hundreds of
  processes at the same time.
* Doing so makes the system easy to use, as one never need be concerned with
  whether a CPU is available; one simply runs programs.
* Hence our challenge:

.The crux of the problem: How to provide the illusion of many CPUs?
****
* Although there are only a few physical CPUs available, how can the OS
  provide the illusion of a nearly-endless supply of said CPUs?
****

* The OS creates this illusion by *virtualizing* the CPU.
* By running one process, then stopping it and running another, and so forth,
  the OS can promote the illusion that many virtual CPUs exist when in fact
  there is only one physical CPU (or a few).
* This basic technique, known as *time sharing* of the CPU, allows users to
  run as many concurrent processes as they would like; the potential cost is
  performance, as each will run more slowly if the CPU(s) must be shared.

'''

* To implement virtualization of the CPU, and to implement it well, the OS
  will need both some low-level machinery and some high-level intelligence.
* We call the low-level machinery *mechanisms*; mechanisms are low-level
  methods or protocols that implement a needed piece of functionality.
* For example, we'll learn later how to implement a *context switch*, which
  gives the OS the ability to stop running one program and start running
  another on a given CPU; this *time-sharing* mechanism is employed by all
  modern OSes.

.Tip: Use time sharing (and space sharing)
****
* *Time sharing* is a basic technique used by an OS to share a resource.
* By allowing the resource to be used for a little while by one entity, and
  then a little while by another, and so forth, the resource in question
  (e.g., the CPU, or a network link) can be shared by many.
* The counterpart of time sharing is *space sharing*, where a resource is
  divided (in space) among those who wish to use it.
* For example, disk space is naturally a space-shared resource; once a block
  is assigned to a file, it is normally not assigned to another file until the
  user deletes the original file.
****

* On top of these mechanisms resides some of the intelligence in the OS, in
  the form of *policies*.
* Policies are algorithms for making some kind of decision within the OS.
* For example, given a number of possible programs to run on a CPU, which
  program should the OS run?
* A *scheduling policy* in the OS will make this decision, likely using
  historical information (e.g., which program has run more over the last
  minute?), workload knowledge (e.g., what types of programs are run), and
  performance metrics (e.g., is the system optimizing for interactive
  performance, or throughput?) to make its decision.

== 4.1 The Abstraction: A Process

* The abstraction provided by the OS of a running program is something we will
  call a *process*.
* As we said above, a process is simply a running program; at any instant in
  time, we can summarize a process by taking an inventory of the different
  pieces of the system it accesses or affects during the course of its
  execution.

'''

* To understand what constitutes a process, we thus have to understand its
  *machine state*: what a program can read or update when it is running.
* At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execution
  of this program?

'''

* One obvious component of machine state that comprises a process is its
  _memory_.
* Instructions lie in memory; the data that the running program reads and
  writes sits in memory as well.
* Thus the memory that the process can address (called its *address space*) is
  part of the process.

'''

* Also part of the process's machine state are _registers_; many instructions
  explicitly read or update registers and thus clearly they are important to
  the execution of the process.

'''

* Note that there are some particularly special registers that form part of
  this machine state.
* For example, the *program counter* (*PC*) (sometimes called the *instruction
  pointer* or *IP*) tells us which instruction of the program will execute
  next; similarly a *stack pointer* and associated *frame pointer* are used to
  manage the stack for function parameters, local variables, and return
  addresses.

.Tip: Separate policy and mechanism
****
* In many operating systems, a common design paradigm is to separate
  high-level policies from their low-level mechanisms [L+75].
* You can think of the mechanism as providing the answer to a _how_ question
  about a system; for example, _how_ does an operating system perform a
  context switch?
* The policy provides the answer to a _which_ question; for example, _which_
  process should the operating system run right now?
* Separating the two allows one easily to change policies without having to
  rethink the mechanism and is thus a form of *modularity*, a general software
  design principle.
****

* Finally, programs often access persistent storage devices too.
* Such _I/O information_ might include a list of the files the process
  currently has open.

== 4.2 Process API

* Though we defer discussion of a real process API until a subsequent chapter,
  here we first give some idea of what must be included in any interface of an
  operating system.
* These APIs, in some form, are available on any modern operating system.

'''

Create::
* An operating system must include some method to create new processes.
* When you type a command into the shell, or double-click on an application
  icon, the OS is invoked to create a new process to run the program you have
  indicated.

Destroy::
* As there is an interface for process creation, systems also provide an
  interface to destroy processes forcefully.
* Of course, many processes will run and just exit by themselves when
  complete; when they don't, however, the user may wish to kill them, and thus
  an interface to halt a runaway process is quite useful.

Wait::
* Sometimes it is useful to wait for a process to stop running; thus some kind
  of waiting interface is often provided.

Miscellaneous Control::
* Other than killing or waiting for a process, there are sometimes other
  controls that are possible.
* For example, most operating systems provide some kind of method to suspend a
  process (stop it from running for a while) and then resume it (continue it
  running).

Status::
* There are usually interfaces to get some status information about a process
  as well, such as how long it has run for, or what state it is in.

== 4.3 Process Creation: A Little More Detail

* One mystery that we should unmask a bit is how programs are transformed into
  processes.
* Specifically, how does the OS get a program up and running?
* How does process creation actually work?

'''

* The first thing that the OS must do to run a program is to *load* its code
  and any static data (e.g., initialized variables) into memory, into the
  address space of the process.
* Programs initially reside on *disk* (or, in some modern systems,
  *flash-based SSDs*) in some kind of *executable format*; thus, the process
  of loading a program and static data into memory requires the OS to read
  those bytes from disk and place them in memory somewhere (as shown in Figure
  4.1).

.{figure-caption} {figure-number}. Loading: From Program To Process
image::figure-04-01.png[]

* In early (or simple) operating systems, the loading process is done
  *eagerly*, i.e., all at once before running the program; modern OSes perform
  the process *lazily*, i.e., by loading pieces of code or data only as they
  are needed during program execution.
* To truly understand how lazy loading of pieces of code and data works,
  you'll have to understand more about the machinery of *paging* and
  *swapping*, topics we'll cover in the future when we discuss the
  virtualization of memory.
* For now, just remember that before running anything, the OS clearly must do
  some work to get the important program bits from disk into memory.

'''

* Once the code and static data are loaded into memory, there are a few other
  things the OS needs to do before running the process.
* Some memory must be allocated for the program's *run-time stack* (or just
  *stack*).
* As you should likely already know, C programs use the stack for local
  variables, function parameters, and return addresses; the OS allocates this
  memory and gives it to the process.
* The OS will also likely initialize the stack with arguments; specifically,
  it will fill in the parameters to the `main()` function, i.e., `argc` and
  the `argv` array.

'''

* The OS may also allocate some memory for the program's *heap*.
* In C programs, the heap is used for explicitly requested
  dynamically-allocated data; programs request such space by calling
  `malloc()` and free it explicitly by calling `free()`.
* The heap is needed for data structures such as linked lists, hash tables,
  trees, and other interesting data structures.
* The heap will be small at first; as the program runs, and requests more
  memory via the `malloc()` library API, the OS may get involved and allocate
  more memory to the process to help satisfy such calls.

'''

* The OS will also do some other initialization tasks, particularly as related
  to input/output (I/O).
* For example, in UNIX systems, each process by default has three open *file
  descriptors*, for standard input, output, and error; these descriptors let
  programs easily read input from the terminal and print output to the screen.
* We'll learn more about I/O, file descriptors, and the like in the third part
  of the book on *persistence*.

'''

* By loading the code and static data into memory, by creating and
  initializing a stack, and by doing other work as related to I/O setup, the
  OS has now (finally) set the stage for program execution.
* It thus has one last task: to start the program running at the entry point,
  namely `main()`.
* By jumping to the `main()` routine (through a specialized mechanism that we
  will discuss next chapter), the OS transfers control of the CPU to the
  newly-created process, and thus the program begins its execution.
