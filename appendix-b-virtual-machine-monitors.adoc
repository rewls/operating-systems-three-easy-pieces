= B Virtual Machine Monitors

== B.1 Introduction

* Years ago, IBM sold expensive mainframes to large organizations, and a
  problem arose: what if the organization wanted to run different operating
  systems on the machine at the same time?
* Some applications had been developed on one OS, and some on others, and thus
  the problem.
* As a solution, IBM introduced yet another level of indirection in the form
  of a *virtual machine monitor* (*VMM*) (also called a *hypervisor*) [G74].

'''

* Specifically, the monitor sits between one or more operating systems and the
  hardware and gives the illusion to each running OS that it controls the
  machine.
* Behind the scenes, however, the monitor actually is in control of the
  hardware, and must multiplex running OSes across the physical resources of
  the machine.
* Indeed, the VMM serves as an operating system for operating systems, but at
  a much lower level; the OS must still think it is interacting with the
  physical hardware.
* Thus, transparency is a major goal of VMMs.

'''

* Thus, we find ourselves in a funny position: the OS has thus far served as
  the master illusionist, tricking unsuspecting applications into thinking
  they have their own private CPU and a large virtual memory, while secretly
  switching between applications and sharing memory as well.
* Now, we have to do it again, but this time underneath the OS, who is used to
  being in charge.
* How can the VMM create this illusion for each OS running on top of it?

.The Crux: How to virtualize the machine underneath the OS
****
* The virtual machine monitor must transparently virtualize the machine
  underneath the OS; what are the techniques required to do so?

== B.2 Motivation: Why VMMs?

* Today, VMMs have become popular again for a multitude of reasons.
* Server consolidation is one such reason.
* In many settings, people run services on different machines which run
  different operating systems (or even OS versions), and yet each machine is
  lightly utilized.
* In this case, virtualization enables an administrator to consolidate
  multiple OSes onto fewer hardware platforms, and thus lower costs and ease
  administration.

'''

* Virtualization has also become popular on desktops, as many users wish to
  run one operating system (say Linux or Mac OS X) but still have access to
  native applications on a different platform (say Windows).
* This type of improvement in functionality is also a good reason.

'''

* Another reason is testing and debugging.
* While developers write code on one main platform, they often want to debug
  and test it on the many different platforms that they deploy the software to
  in the field.
* Thus, virtualization makes it easy to do so, by enabling a developer to run
  many operating system types and versions on just one machine.

'''

* This resurgence in virtualization began in earnest the mid-to-late 1990's,
  and was led by a group of researchers at Stanford headed by Professor Mendel
  Rosenblum.
* His group's work on Disco [B+97], a virtual machine monitor for the MIPS
  processor, was an early effort that revived VMMs and eventually led that
  group to the founding of VMware [V98], now a market leader in virtualization
  technology.
* In this chapter, we will discuss the primary technology underlying Disco and
  through that window try to understand how virtualization works.

* The paper that reintroduced the systems community to virtual machine
  research; well, perhaps this is unfair as Bressoud and Schneider [BS95] also
  did, but here we began to understand why virtualization was going to come
  back.
* What made it even clearer, however, is when this group of excellent
  researchers started VMware and made some billions of dollars.

* One the earliest papers to bring back the hypervisor, which is just another
  term for a virtual machine monitor.
* In this work, however, such hypervisors are used to improve system tolerance
  of hardware faults, which is perhaps less useful than some of the more
  practical scenarios discussed in this chapter; however, still quite an
  intriguing paper in its own right.
