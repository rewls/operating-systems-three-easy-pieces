= B Virtual Machine Monitors

== B.1 Introduction

* Years ago, IBM sold expensive mainframes to large organizations, and a
  problem arose: what if the organization wanted to run different operating
  systems on the machine at the same time?
* Some applications had been developed on one OS, and some on others, and thus
  the problem.
* As a solution, IBM introduced yet another level of indirection in the form
  of a *virtual machine monitor* (*VMM*) (also called a *hypervisor*) [G74].

'''

* Specifically, the monitor sits between one or more operating systems and the
  hardware and gives the illusion to each running OS that it controls the
  machine.
* Behind the scenes, however, the monitor actually is in control of the
  hardware, and must multiplex running OSes across the physical resources of
  the machine.
* Indeed, the VMM serves as an operating system for operating systems, but at
  a much lower level; the OS must still think it is interacting with the
  physical hardware.
* Thus, transparency is a major goal of VMMs.

'''

* Thus, we find ourselves in a funny position: the OS has thus far served as
  the master illusionist, tricking unsuspecting applications into thinking
  they have their own private CPU and a large virtual memory, while secretly
  switching between applications and sharing memory as well.
* Now, we have to do it again, but this time underneath the OS, who is used to
  being in charge.
* How can the VMM create this illusion for each OS running on top of it?

.The Crux: How to virtualize the machine underneath the OS

* The virtual machine monitor must transparently virtualize the machine
  underneath the OS; what are the techniques required to do so?
