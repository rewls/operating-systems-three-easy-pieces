* Under Linux you can disable ASLR, without using a debugger, in (at least) two ways:

* Use the command `setarch` to run a process with ASLR disabled; I typically
  run bash, with which I can execute examples, like this: `setarch $(uname
  --machine) --addr-no-randomize /bin/bash`
* Writing 0 into `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`; you need to be root to
  do this and this change has (a non-permanent) effect on the whole system,
  which is something you probably don't want. +
  I use this one only inside VMs.
