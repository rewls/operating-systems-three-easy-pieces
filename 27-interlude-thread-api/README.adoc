= 27 Interlude: Thread API
:figure-caption: Figure 27.
:toc: left

* This chapter briefly covers the main portions of the thread API.
* Each part will be explained further in the subsequent chapters, as we show
  how to use the API.
* More details can be found in various books and online sources [B89, B97,
  B+96, K+96].
* We should note that the subsequent chapters introduce the concepts of locks
  and condition variables more slowly, with many examples; this chapter is
  thus better used as a reference.

.Crux: How to create and control threads
****
* What interfaces should the OS present for thread creation and control?
* How should these interfaces be designed to enable ease of use as well as
  utility?

== 27.1 Thread Creation

* The first thing you have to be able to do to write a multi-threaded program
  is to create new threads, and thus some kind of thread creation interface
  must exist.
* In POSIX, it is easy:

[source,c]
#include <pthread.h>
int
pthread_create(pthread_t *thread,
		const pthread_attr_t *attr,
		void *(*start_routine)(void*),
		void *arg);

'''

* This declaration might look a little complex (particularly if you haven't
  used function pointers in C), but actually it's not too bad.
* There are four arguments: `thread`, `attr`, `start_routine`, and `arg`.
* The first, `thread`, is a pointer to a structure of type `pthread_t`; we'll
  use this structure to interact with this thread, and thus we need to pass it
  to `pthread_create()` in order to initialize it.

'''

* The second argument, `attr`, is used to specify any attributes this thread
  might have.
* Some examples include setting the stack size or perhaps information about
  the scheduling priority of the thread.
* An attribute is initialized with a separate call to `pthread_attr_init()`;
  see the manual page for details.
* However, in most cases, the defaults will be fine; in this case, we will
  simply pass the value `NULL` in.

'''

* The third argument is the most complex, but is really just asking: which
  function should this thread start running in?
* In C, we call this a function pointer, and this one tells us the following
  is expected: a function name (start routine), which is passed a single
  argument of type `void *` (as indicated in the parentheses after start
  routine), and which returns a value of type `void *` (i.e., a *void
  pointer*).

'''

* If this routine instead required an integer argument, instead of a void
  pointer, the declaration would look like this:

[source,c]
int pthread_create(..., // first two args are the same
		void *(*start_routine)(int),
		int arg);

* If instead the routine took a void pointer as an argument, but returned
an integer, it would look like this:

[source,c]
int pthread_create(..., // first two args are the same
		int (*start_routine)(void *),
		void *arg);

'''

* Finally, the fourth argument, `arg`, is exactly the argument to be passed to
  the function where the thread begins execution.
* You might ask: why do we need these void pointers?
* Well, the answer is quite simple: having a void pointer as an argument to
  the function start routine allows us to pass in any type of argument; having
  it as a return value allows the thread to return any type of result.

'''

* Let's look at an example in Figure 27.1.
* Here we just create a thread that is passed two arguments, packaged into a
  single type we define ourselves (`myarg_t`).
* The thread, once created, can simply cast its argument to the type it
  expects and thus unpack the arguments as desired.

.{figure-caption} {figure-number}. Creating a Thread
[,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

typedef struct {
    int a;
    int b;
} myarg_t;

void *mythread(void *arg) {
    myarg_t *args = (myarg_t *) arg;
    printf("%d %d\n", args->a, args->b);
    return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    pthread_t p;
    myarg_t args = { 10, 20 };

    int rc = pthread_create(&p, NULL, mythread, &args);
    ...
}
----

* And there it is!
* Once you create a thread, you really have another live executing entity,
  complete with its own call stack, running within the same address space as
  all the currently existing threads in the program.
* The fun thus begins!
