= Homeworks
:toc: left

* Each chapter has some questions at the end; we call these "homeworks",
  because you should do the "work" at your "home".
* Make sense?
* It's one of the innovations of this book.

'''

* Homeworks can be used to solidify your knowledge of the material in each of
  the chapters.
* Many homeworks are based on running a simulator, which mimic some aspect of
  an operating system.
* For example, a disk scheduling simulator could be useful in understanding
  how different disk scheduling algorithms work.
* Some other homeworks are just short programming exercises, allowing you to
  explore how real systems work.

'''

* For the simulators, the basic idea is simple: each of the simulators below
  let you both generate problems and obtain solutions for an infinite number
  of problems.
* Different random seeds can usually be used to generate different problems;
  using the `-c` flag computes the answers for you (presumably after you have
  tried to compute them yourself!).

'''

* Each homework included below has a README file that explains what to do.
* Previously, this material had been included in the chapters themselves, but
  that was making the book too long.
* Now, all that is left in the book are the questions you might want to answer
  with the simulator; the details on how to run code are all in the README.

'''

* Thus, your task: read a chapter, look at the questions at the end of the
  chapter, and try to answer them by doing the homework.
* Some require a simulator (written in Python); those are available by below.
* Some others require you to write some code.
* At this point, reading the relevant README is a good idea.
* Still others require some other stuff, like writing C code to accomplish
  some task.

'''

* To use these, the best thing to do is to clone the homeworks.
* For example:
