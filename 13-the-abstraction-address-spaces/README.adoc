* In the early days, building computer systems was easy.
* Why, you ask?
* Because users didn't expect much.
* It is those darned users with their expectations of "ease of use", "high
  performance", "reliability", etc., that really have led to all these
  headaches.
* Next time you meet one of those computer users, thank them for all the
  problems they have caused.

== 13.1 Early Systems

* From the perspective of memory, early machines didn't provide much of an
  abstraction to users.
* Basically, the physical memory of the machine looked something like what you
  see in Figure 13.1 (page 2).

* The OS was a set of routines (a library, really) that sat in memory
  (starting at physical address 0 in this example), and there would be one
  running program (a process) that currently sat in physical memory (starting
  at physical address 64k in this example) and used the rest of memory.
* There were few illusions here, and the user didn't expect much from the OS.
* Life was sure easy for OS developers in those days, wasn't it?
