* Thus far we have developed the notion of a lock and seen how one can be
  properly built with the right combination of hardware and OS support.
* Unfortunately, locks are not the only primitives that are needed to build
  concurrent programs.

'''

* In particular, there are many cases where a thread wishes to check whether a
  condition is true before continuing its execution.
* For example, a parent thread might wish to check whether a child thread has
  completed before continuing (this is often called a `join()`); how should
  such a wait be implemented?
* Let's look at Figure 30.1.

* What we would like to see here is the following output:

'''

* We could try using a shared variable, as you see in Figure 30.2.
* This solution will generally work, but it is hugely inefficient as the
  parent spins and wastes CPU time.
* What we would like here instead is some way to put the parent to sleep until
  the condition we are waiting for (e.g., the child is done executing) comes
  true.

.The crux: How to wait for a condition
****
* In multi-threaded programs, it is often useful for a thread to wait for some
  condition to become true before proceeding.
* The simple approach, of just spinning until the condition becomes true, is
  grossly inefficient and wastes CPU cycles, and in some cases, can be
  incorrect.
* Thus, how should a thread wait for a condition?
****

== 30.1 Definition and Routines

* To wait for a condition to become true, a thread can make use of what is
  known as a *condition variable*.
* A *condition variable* is an explicit queue that threads can put themselves
  on when some state of execution (i.e., some *condition*) is not as desired
  (by *waiting* on the condition); some other thread, when it changes said
  state, can then wake one (or more) of those waiting threads and thus allow
  them to continue (by *signaling* on the condition).
* The idea goes back to Dijkstra's use of "private semaphores" [D68]; a
  similar idea was later named a "condition variable" by Hoare in his work on
  monitors [H74].

'''

* To declare such a condition variable, one simply writes something like this:
  `pthread_cond_t c;`, which declares `c` as a condition variable (note:
  proper initialization is also required).
* A condition variable has two operations associated with it: `wait()` and
  `signal()`.
* The `wait()` call is executed when a thread wishes to put itself to sleep;
  the `signal()` call is executed when a thread has changed something in the
  program and thus wants to wake a sleeping thread waiting on this condition.
* Specifically, the POSIX calls look like this:

[source,c]
pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *c, pthread_mutex_t *m);
pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *c);

'''

* We will often refer to these as `wait()` and `signal()` for simplicity.
* One thing you might notice about the `wait()` call is that it also takes a
  mutex as a parameter; it assumes that this mutex is locked when `wait()` is
  called.
* The responsibility of `wait()` is to release the lock and put the calling
  thread to sleep (atomically); when the thread wakes up (after some other
  thread has signaled it), it must re-acquire the lock before returning to the
  caller.
* This complexity stems from the desire to prevent certain race conditions
  from occurring when a thread is trying to put itself to sleep.
* Let's take a look at the solution to the join problem (Figure 30.3) to
  understand this better.

pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t c = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

	done = 1;

	pthread_t p;
	Pthread_create(&p, NULL, child, NULL);
	thr_join();
	printf("parent: end\n");
	return 0;
}
----

* There are two cases to consider.
* In the first, the parent creates the child thread but continues running
  itself (assume we have only a single processor) and thus immediately calls
  into `thr_join()` to wait for the child thread to complete.
* In this case, it will acquire the lock, check if the child is done (it is
  not), and put itself to sleep by calling `wait()` (hence releasing the
  lock).
* The child will eventually run, print the message "child", and call
  `thr_exit()` to wake the parent thread; this code just grabs the lock, sets
  the state variable done, and signals the parent thus waking it.
* Finally, the parent will run (returning from `wait()` with the lock held),
  unlock the lock, and print the final message "parent: end".

'''

* In the second case, the child runs immediately upon creation, sets `done` to
  1, calls signal to wake a sleeping thread (but there is none, so it just
  returns), and is done.
* The parent then runs, calls `thr_join()`, sees that `done` is 1, and thus
  does not wait and returns.

'''

* One last note: you might observe the parent uses a `while` loop instead of
  just an `if` statement when deciding whether to wait on the condition.
* While this does not seem strictly necessary per the logic of the program, it
  is always a good idea, as we will see below.

'''

* To make sure you understand the importance of each piece of the `thr_exit()`
  and `thr_join()` code, let's try a few alternate implementations.
* First, you might be wondering if we need the state variable `done`.
* What if the code looked like the example below? (Figure 30.4)

:figure-number: {counter:figure-number}
.{figure-caption} {figure-number}. Parent Waiting: No State Variable
[,c]
----
void thr_exit() {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	Pthread_cond_signal(&c);
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}

void thr_join() {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	Pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
----

* Unfortunately this approach is broken.
* Imagine the case where the child runs immediately and calls `thr_exit()`
  immediately; in this case, the child will signal, but there is no thread
  asleep on the condition.
* When the parent runs, it will simply call wait and be stuck; no thread will
  ever wake it.
* From this example, you should appreciate the importance of the state
  variable `done`; it records the value the threads are interested in knowing.
* The sleeping, waking, and locking all are built around it.

'''

* Here (Figure 30.5) is another poor implementation.
* In this example, we imagine that one does not need to hold a lock in order
  to signal and wait.
* What problem could occur here?
* Think about it{empty}footnote:[Note that this example is not "real" code,
  because the call to `pthread_cond_wait()` always requires a mutex as well as
  a condition variable; here, we just pretend that the interface does not do
  so for the sake of the negative example.]!

:figure-number: {counter:figure-number}
[,c]
----
void thr_exit() {
	done = 1;
	Pthread_cond_signal(&c);
}

void thr_join() {
	if (done == 0)
		Pthread_cond_wait(&c);
}
----

* The issue here is a subtle race condition.
* Specifically, if the parent calls `thr_join()` and then checks the value of
  `done`, it will see that it is 0 and thus try to go to sleep.
* But just before it calls wait to go to sleep, the parent is interrupted, and
  the child runs.
* The child changes the state variable done to 1 and signals, but no thread is
  waiting and thus no thread is woken.
* When the parent runs again, it sleeps forever, which is sad.

'''

* Hopefully, from this simple join example, you can see some of the basic
  requirements of using condition variables properly.
* To make sure you understand, we now go through a more complicated example:
  the *producer/consumer* or *bounded-buffer* problem.

.Tip: Always hold the lock while signaling
****
* Although it is strictly not necessary in all cases, it is likely simplest
  and best to hold the lock while signaling when using condition variables.
* The example above shows a case where you _must_ hold the lock for
  correctness; however, there are some other cases where it is likely OK not
  to, but probably is something you should avoid.
* Thus, for simplicity, *hold the lock when calling signal*.

'''

* The converse of this tip, i.e., hold the lock when calling wait, is not just
  a tip, but rather mandated by the semantics of wait, because wait always (a)
  assumes the lock is held when you call it, (b) releases said lock when
  putting the caller to sleep, and (c) re-acquires the lock just before
  returning.
* Thus, the generalization of this tip is correct: *hold the lock when calling
  signal or wait*, and you will always be in good shape.
****

== 30.2 The Producer/Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem

* The next synchronization problem we will confront in this chapter is known
  as the *producer/consumer* problem, or sometimes as the *bounded buffer*
  problem, which was first posed by Dijkstra [D72].
* Indeed, it was this very producer/consumer problem that led Dijkstra and his
  co-workers to invent the generalized semaphore (which can be used as either
  a lock or a condition variable) [D01]; we will learn more about semaphores
  later.

'''

* Imagine one or more producer threads and one or more consumer threads.
* Producers generate data items and place them in a buffer; consumers grab
  said items from the buffer and consume them in some way.

'''

* This arrangement occurs in many real systems.
* For example, in a multi-threaded web server, a producer puts HTTP requests
  into a work queue (i.e., the bounded buffer); consumer threads take requests
  out of this queue and process them.

'''

* A bounded buffer is also used when you pipe the output of one program into
  another, e.g., `grep foo file.txt | wc -l`.
* This example runs two processes concurrently; `grep` writes lines from
  `file.txt` with the string `foo` in them to what it thinks is standard
  output; the UNIX shell redirects the output to what is called a UNIX pipe
  (created by the *pipe* system call).
* The other end of this pipe is connected to the standard input of the process
  `wc`, which simply counts the number of lines in the input stream and prints
  out the result.
* Thus, the `grep` process is the producer; the `wc` process is the consumer;
  between them is an in-kernel bounded buffer; you, in this example, are just
  the happy user.

'''

* Because the bounded buffer is a shared resource, we must of course require
  synchronized access to it, lest{empty}footnote:[This is where we drop some
  serious Old English on you, and the subjunctive form.] a race condition
  arise.
* To begin to understand this problem better, let us examine some actual code.
* The first thing we need is a shared buffer, into which a producer puts data,
  and out of which a consumer takes data.
* Let's just use a single integer for simplicity (you can certainly imagine
  placing a pointer to a data structure into this slot instead), and the two
  inner routines to put a value into the shared buffer, and to get a value out
  of the buffer.
* See Figure 30.6 (page 6) for details.

:figure-number: {counter:figure-number}
.{figure-caption} {figure-number}. The Put And Get Routines (v1)
[,c]
----
int buffer;
int count = 0; // initially, empty

void put(int value) {
	assert(count == 0);
	count = 1;
	buffer = value;
}

int get() {
	assert(count == 1);
	count = 0;
	return buffer;
}
----

* Pretty simple, no?
* The `put()` routine assumes the buffer is empty (and checks this with an
  assertion), and then simply puts a value into the shared buffer and marks it
  full by setting `count` to 1.
* The `get()` routine does the opposite, setting the buffer to empty (i.e.,
  setting `count` to 0) and returning the value.
* Don't worry that this shared buffer has just a single entry; later, we'll
  generalize it to a queue that can hold multiple entries, which will be even
  more fun than it sounds.

'''

* Now we need to write some routines that know when it is OK to access the
  buffer to either put data into it or get data out of it.
* The conditions for this should be obvious: only put data into the buffer
  when count is zero (i.e., when the buffer is empty), and only get data from
  the buffer when count is one (i.e., when the buffer is full).
* If we write the synchronization code such that a producer puts data into a
  full buffer, or a consumer gets data from an empty one, we have done
  something wrong (and in this code, an assertion will fire).

'''

* This work is going to be done by two types of threads, one set of which
  we'll call the *producer* threads, and the other set which we'll call
  *consumer* threads.
* Figure 30.7 shows the code for a producer that puts an integer into the
  shared buffer `loops` number of times, and a consumer that gets the data out
  of that shared buffer (forever), each time printing out the data item it
  pulled from the shared buffer.

=== A Broken Solution

* Now imagine that we have just a single producer and a single consumer.
* Obviously the `put()` and `get()` routines have critical sections within
  them, as `put()` updates the buffer, and `get()` reads from it.
* However, putting a lock around the code doesn't work; we need something
  more.
* Not surprisingly, that something more is some condition variables.
* In this (broken) first try (Figure 30.8), we have a single condition
  variable `cond` and associated lock `mutex`.

----

* Let's examine the signaling logic between producers and consumers.
* When a producer wants to fill the buffer, it waits for it to be empty
  (p1-p3).
* The consumer has the exact same logic, but waits for a different condition:
  fullness (c1-c3).

'''

* With just a single producer and a single consumer, the code in Figure 30.8
  works.
* However, if we have more than one of these threads (e.g., two consumers),
  the solution has two critical problems.
* What are they?

'''

* ... _(pause here to think)_ ...

'''

* Let's understand the first problem, which has to do with the `if` statement
  before the wait.
* Assume there are two consumers (stem:[T_{c1}] and stem:[T_{c2}]) and one
  producer (stem:[T_p]).
* First, a consumer (stem:[T_{c1}]) runs; it acquires the lock (c1), checks if
  any buffers are ready for consumption (c2), and finding that none are, waits
  (c3) (which releases the lock).
* Then the producer (stem:[T_p]) runs.
* It acquires the lock (p1), checks if all buffers are full (p2), and finding
  that not to be the case, goes ahead and fills the buffer (p4).
* The producer then signals that a buffer has been filled (p5).
* Critically, this moves the first consumer (stem:[T_{c1}]) from sleeping on a
  condition variable to the ready queue; stem:[T_{c1}] is now able to run (but
  not yet running).
* The producer then continues until realizing the buffer is full, at which
  point it sleeps (p6, p1-p3).

'''

* Here is where the problem occurs: another consumer (stem:[T_{c2}]) sneaks in
  and consumes the one existing value in the buffer (c1, c2, c4, c5, c6,
  skipping the wait at c3 because the buffer is full).
* Now assume stem:[T_{c1}] runs; just before returning from the wait, it
  re-acquires the lock and then returns.
* It then calls `get()` (c4), but there are no buffers to consume!
* An assertion triggers, and the code has not functioned as desired.
* Clearly, we should have somehow prevented stem:[T_{c1}] from trying to
  consume because stem:[T_{c2}] snuck in and consumed the one value in the
  buffer that had been produced.
* Figure 30.9 shows the action each thread takes, as well as its scheduler
  state (Ready, Running, or Sleeping) over time.

.Thread Trace: Broken Solution (v1)
image::figure-30-09.jpg[]

* The problem arises for a simple reason: after the producer woke
  stem:[T_{c1}], but before stem:[T_{c1}] ever ran, the state of the bounded
  buffer changed (thanks to stem:[T_{c2}]).
* Signaling a thread only wakes them up; it is thus a hint that the state of
  the world has changed (in this case, that a value has been placed in the
  buffer), but there is no guarantee that when the woken thread runs, the
  state will still be as desired.
* This interpretation of what a signal means is often referred to as *Mesa
  semantics*, after the first research that built a condition variable in such
  a manner [LR80]; the contrast, referred to as *Hoare semantics*, is harder
  to build but provides a stronger guarantee that the woken thread will run
  immediately upon being woken [H74].
* Virtually every system ever built employs Mesa semantics.

=== Better, But Still Broken: While, Not If

* Fortunately, this fix is easy (Figure 30.10): change the `if` to a `while`.
* Think about why this works; now consumer stem:[T_{c1}] wakes up and (with
  the lock held) immediately re-checks the state of the shared variable (c2).
* If the buffer is empty at that point, the consumer simply goes back to sleep
  (c3).
* The corollary `if` is also changed to a `while` in the producer (p2).

* Thanks to Mesa semantics, a simple rule to remember with condition variables
  is to *always use while loops*.

'''

* However, this code still has a bug, the second of two problems mentioned
  above.

* It has something to do with the fact that there is only one condition
  variable.
* Try to figure out what the problem is, before reading ahead.
* DO IT!
* _(pause for you to think, or close your eyes...)_

'''

* Let's confirm you figured it out correctly, or perhaps let's confirm that
  you are now awake and reading this part of the book.
* The problem occurs when two consumers run first (stem:[T_{c1}] and
  stem:[T_{c2}]) and both go to sleep (c3).
* Then, the producer runs, puts a value in the buffer, and wakes one of the
  consumers (say stem:[T_{c1}]).
* The producer then loops back (releasing and reacquiring the lock along the
  way) and tries to put more data in the buffer; because the buffer is full,
  the producer instead waits on the condition (thus sleeping).
* Now, one consumer is ready to run (stem:[T_{c1}]), and two threads are
  sleeping on a condition (stem:[T_{c2}] and stem:[T_{p}]).
* We are about to cause a problem: things are getting exciting!

'''

* The consumer stem:[T_{c1}] then wakes by returning from `wait()` (c3),
  re-checks the condition (c2), and finding the buffer full, consumes the
  value (c4).
* This consumer then, critically, signals on the condition (c5), waking only
  one thread that is sleeping.
* However, which thread should it wake?

'''

* Because the consumer has emptied the buffer, it clearly should wake the
  producer.
* However, if it wakes the consumer stem:[T_{c2}] (which is definitely
  possible, depending on how the wait queue is managed), we have a problem.
* Specifically, the consumer stem:[T_{c2}] will wake up and find the buffer
  empty (c2), and go back to sleep (c3).
* The producer stem:[T_p], which has a value to put into the buffer, is left
  sleeping.
* The other consumer thread, stem:[T_{c1}], also goes back to sleep.
* All three threads are left sleeping, a clear bug; see Figure 30.11 for the
  brutal step-by-step of this terrible calamity.

.Thread Trace: Broken Solution (v2)
image::figure-30-11.jpg[]

* Signaling is clearly needed, but must be more directed.
* A consumer should not wake other consumers, only producers, and vice-versa.

=== The Single Buffer Producer/Consumer Solution

* The solution here is once again a small one: use _two_ condition variables,
  instead of one, in order to properly signal which type of thread should wake
  up when the state of the system changes.
* Figure 30.12 shows the resulting code.

* In the code, producer threads wait on the condition *empty*, and signals
  *fill*.
* Conversely, consumer threads wait on *fill* and signal *empty*.
* By doing so, the second problem above is avoided by design: a consumer can
  never accidentally wake a consumer, and a producer can never accidentally
  wake a producer.

.Tip: Use while (not if) for conditions
****
* When checking for a condition in a multi-threaded program, using a `while`
  loop is always correct; using an `if` statement only might be, depending on
  the semantics of signaling.
* Thus, always use `while` and your code will behave as expected.

'''

* Using while loops around conditional checks also handles the case where
  *spurious wakeups* occur.
* In some thread packages, due to details of the implementation, it is
  possible that two threads get woken up though just a single signal has taken
  place [L11].
* Spurious wakeups are further reason to re-check the condition a thread is
  waiting on.
****

=== The Correct Producer/Consumer Solution

* We now have a working producer/consumer solution, albeit not a fully general
  one.
* The last change we make is to enable more concurrency and efficiency;
  specifically, we add more buffer slots, so that multiple values can be
  produced before sleeping, and similarly multiple values can be consumed
  before sleeping.
* With just a single producer and consumer, this approach is more efficient as
  it reduces context switches; with multiple producers or consumers (or both),
  it even allows concurrent producing or consuming to take place, thus
  increasing concurrency.
* Fortunately, it is a small change from our current solution.

'''

* The first change for this correct solution is within the buffer structure
  itself and the corresponding `put()` and `get()` (Figure 30.13).
* We also slightly change the conditions that producers and consumers check in
  order to determine whether to sleep or not.
* We also show the correct waiting and signaling logic (Figure 30.14).
* A producer only sleeps if all buffers are currently filled (p2); similarly,
  a consumer only sleeps if all buffers are currently empty (c2).
* And thus we solve the producer/consumer problem; time to sit back and drink
  a cold one.

== 30.3 Covering Conditions

* We'll now look at one more example of how condition variables can be used.
* This code study is drawn from Lampson and Redell's paper on Pilot [LR80],
  the same group who first implemented the Mesa semantics described above (the
  language they used was Mesa, hence the name).

'''

* The problem they ran into is best shown via simple example, in this case in
  a simple multi-threaded memory allocation library.
* Figure 30.15 shows a code snippet which demonstrates the issue.

// how many bytes of the heap are free?
int bytesLeft = MAX_HEAP_SIZE;

// need lock and condition too
cond_t c;
mutex_t m;

void *
allocate(int size) {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	while (bytesLeft < size)
		Pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
	void *ptr = ...; // get mem from heap
	bytesLeft -= size;
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
	return ptr;
}

void free(void *ptr, int size) {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	bytesLeft += size;
	Pthread_cond_signal(&c); // whom to signal??
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
----

* As you might see in the code, when a thread calls into the memory allocation
  code, it might have to wait in order for more memory to become free.
* Conversely, when a thread frees memory, it signals that more memory is free.
* However, our code above has a problem: which waiting thread (there can be
  more than one) should be woken up?

'''

* Consider the following scenario.
* Assume there are zero bytes free; thread stem:[T_a] calls
  `allocate(100)`, followed by thread stem:[T_b] which asks for less memory by
  calling `allocate(10)`.
* Both stem:[T_a] and stem:[T_b] thus wait on the condition and go to sleep;
  there aren't enough free bytes to satisfy either of these requests.

'''

* At that point, assume a third thread, stem:[T_c], calls `free(50)`.
* Unfortunately, when it calls signal to wake a waiting thread, it might not
  wake the correct waiting thread, stem:[T_b], which is waiting for only 10
  bytes to be freed; stem:[T_a] should remain waiting, as not enough memory is yet free.
* Thus, the code in the figure does not work, as the thread waking other
  threads does not know which thread (or threads) to wake up.

'''

* The solution suggested by Lampson and Redell is straightforward: replace the
  `pthread_cond_signal()` call in the code above with a call to
  `pthread_cond_broadcast()`, which wakes up all waiting threads.
* By doing so, we guarantee that any threads that should be woken are.
* The downside, of course, can be a negative performance impact, as we might
  needlessly wake up many other waiting threads that shouldn't (yet) be awake.
* Those threads will simply wake up, re-check the condition, and then go
  immediately back to sleep.
* Lampson and Redell call such a condition a *covering condition*, as it
  covers all the cases where a thread needs to wake up (conservatively); the
  cost, as we've discussed, is that too many threads might be woken.
* The astute reader might also have noticed we could have used this approach
  earlier (see the producer/consumer problem with only a single condition
  variable).
* However, in that case, a better solution was available to us, and thus we
  used it.
* In general, if you find that your program only works when you change your
  signals to broadcasts (but you don't think it should need to), you probably
  have a bug; fix it!
* But in cases like the memory allocator above, broadcast may be the most
  straightforward solution available.

== 30.4 Summary

* We have seen the introduction of another important synchronization primitive
  beyond locks: condition variables.
* By allowing threads to sleep when some program state is not as desired, CVs
  enable us to neatly solve a number of important synchronization problems,
  including the famous (and still important) producer/consumer problem, as
  well as covering conditions.
* A more dramatic concluding sentence would go here, such as "He loved Big
  Brother" [O49].
