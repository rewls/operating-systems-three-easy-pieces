= 18 Paging: Introduction
:toc: left

* It is sometimes said that the operating system takes one of two approaches
  when solving most any space-management problem.
* The first approach is to chop things up into _variable-sized_ pieces, as we
  saw with *segmentation* in virtual memory.
* Unfortunately, this solution has inherent difficulties.
* In particular, when dividing a space into different-size chunks, the space
  itself can become *fragmented*, and thus allocation becomes more challenging
  over time.

'''

* Thus, it may be worth considering the second approach: to chop up space into
  _fixed-sized_ pieces.
* In virtual memory, we call this idea *paging*, and it goes back to an early
  and important system, the Atlas [KE+62, L78].
* Instead of splitting up a process's address space into some number of
  variable-sized logical segments (e.g., code, heap, stack), we divide it into
  fixed-sized units, each of which we call a *page*.
* Correspondingly, we view physical memory as an array of fixed-sized slots
  called *page frames*; each of these frames can contain a single virtual-memory
  page.
* Our challenge:

.The crux: How to virtualize memory with pages
****
* How can we virtualize memory with pages, so as to avoid the problems of
  segmentation?
* What are the basic techniques?
* How do we make those techniques work well, with minimal space and time
  overheads?
