* Before moving beyond locks, we'll first describe how to use locks in some
  common data structures.
* Adding locks to a data structure to make it usable by threads makes the
  structure *thread safe*.
* Of course, exactly how such locks are added determines both the correctness
  and performance of the data structure.
* And thus, our challenge:

.Crux: How to add locks to data structures
****
* When given a particular data structure, how should we add locks to it, in
  order to make it work correctly?
* Further, how do we add locks such that the data structure yields high
  performance, enabling many threads to access the structure at once, i.e.,
  *concurrently*?
****

* Of course, we will be hard pressed to cover all data structures or all
  methods for adding concurrency, as this is a topic that has been studied for
  years, with (literally) thousands of research papers published about it.
* Thus, we hope to provide a sufficient introduction to the type of thinking
  required, and refer you to some good sources of material for further inquiry
  on your own.
* We found Moir and Shavit's survey to be a great source of information
  [MS04].

== 29.1 Concurrent Counters

* One of the simplest data structures is a counter.
* It is a structure that is commonly used and has a simple interface.
* We define a simple non concurrent counter in Figure 29.1.

typedef struct __counter_t {
	int value;
} counter_t;

void init(counter_t *c) {
	c->value = 0;
}

void increment(counter_t *c) {
	c->value++;
}

void decrement(counter_t *c) {
	c->value--;
}

int get(counter_t *c) {
	return c->value;
}
----

=== Simple But Not Scalable

* As you can see, the non-synchronized counter is a trivial data structure,
  requiring a tiny amount of code to implement.
* We now have our next challenge: how can we make this code *thread safe*?
* Figure 29.2 shows how we do so.

typedef struct __counter_t {
	int value;
	pthread_mutex_t lock;
} counter_t;

void init(counter_t *c) {
	c->value = 0;
	Pthread_mutex_init(&c->lock, NULL);
}

void increment(counter_t *c) {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&c->lock);
	c->value++;
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->lock);
}

void decrement(counter_t *c) {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&c->lock);
	c->value--;
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->lock);
}

int get(counter_t *c) {
	Pthread_mutex_lock(&c->lock);
	int rc = c->value;
	Pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->lock);
	return rc;
}
----

* This concurrent counter is simple and works correctly.
* In fact, it follows a design pattern common to the simplest and most basic
  concurrent data structures: it simply adds a single lock, which is acquired
  when calling a routine that manipulates the data structure, and is
  released when returning from the call.
* In this manner, it is similar to a data structure built with *monitors*
  [BH73], where locks are acquired and released automatically as you call and
  return from object methods.

'''

* At this point, you have a working concurrent data structure.
* The problem you might have is performance.
* If your data structure is too slow, you'll have to do more than just add a
  single lock; such optimizations, if needed, are thus the topic of the rest
  of the chapter.
* Note that if the data structure is _not_ too slow, you are done!
* No need to do something fancy if something simple will work.
* To understand the performance costs of the simple approach, we run a
  benchmark in which each thread updates a single shared counter a fixed
  number of times; we then vary the number of threads.
* Figure 29.5 shows the total time taken, with one to four threads active;
  each thread updates the counter one million times.
* This experiment was run upon an iMac with four Intel 2.7 GHz i5 CPUs; with
  more CPUs active, we hope to get more total work done per unit time.

'''

* From the top line in the figure (labeled 'Precise'), you can see that the
  performance of the synchronized counter scales poorly.
* Whereas a single thread can complete the million counter updates in a tiny
  amount of time (roughly 0.03 seconds), having two threads each update the
  counter one million times concurrently leads to a massive slowdown (taking
  over 5 seconds!).
* It only gets worse with more threads.

'''

* Ideally, you'd like to see the threads complete just as quickly on multiple
  processors as the single thread does on one.
* Achieving this end is called *perfect scaling*; even though more work is
  done, it is done in parallel, and hence the time taken to complete the task
  is not increased.

=== Scalable Counting

* Amazingly, researchers have studied how to build more scalable counters for
  years [MS04].
* Even more amazing is the fact that scalable counters matter, as recent work
  in operating system performance analysis has shown [B+10]; without scalable
  counting, some workloads running on Linux suffer from serious scalability
  problems on multicore machines.

'''

* Many techniques have been developed to attack this problem.
* We'll describe one approach known as an *approximate counter* [C06].

'''

* The approximate counter works by representing a single logical counter via
  numerous local physical counters, one per CPU core, as well as a single
  global counter.
* Specifically, on a machine with four CPUs, there are four local counters and
  one global one.
* In addition to these counters, there are also locks: one for each local
  counter{empty}footnote:[We need the local locks because we assume there may
  be more than one thread on each core. If, instead, only one thread ran on
  each core, no local lock would be needed.], and one for the global counter.

'''

* The basic idea of approximate counting is as follows.
* When a thread running on a given core wishes to increment the counter, it
  increments its local counter; access to this local counter is synchronized
  via the corresponding local lock.
* Because each CPU has its own local counter, threads across CPUs can update
  local counters without contention, and thus updates to the counter are
  scalable.

'''

* However, to keep the global counter up to date (in case a thread wishes
  counter, by acquiring the global lock and incrementing it by the local
  counter's value; the local counter is then reset to zero.
* How often this local-to-global transfer occurs is determined by a threshold
  stem:[S].
* The smaller stem:[S] is, the more the counter behaves like the non-scalable
  counter above; the bigger stem:[S] is, the more scalable the counter, but
  the further off the global value might be from the actual count.
* One could simply acquire all the local locks and the global lock (in a
  specified order, to avoid deadlock) to get an exact value, but that is not
  scalable.

'''

* To make this clear, let's look at an example (Figure 29.3).
* In this example, the threshold stem:[S] is set to 5, and there are threads on each
  of four CPUs updating their local counters stem:[L_1 \dots L_4].
* The global counter value (stem:[G]) is also shown in the trace, with time
  increasing downward.
* At each time step, a local counter may be incremented; if the local value
  reaches the threshold stem:[S], the local value is transferred to the global
  counter and the local counter is reset.

* The lower line in Figure 29.5 (labeled 'Approximate', on page 6) shows the
  performance of approximate counters with a threshold stem:[S] of 1024.
* Performance is excellent; the time taken to update the counter four million
  times on four processors is hardly higher than the time taken to update it
  one million times on one processor.

'''

* Figure 29.6 shows the importance of the threshold value stem:[S], with four
  threads each incrementing the counter 1 million times on four CPUs.
* If stem:[S] is low, performance is poor (but the global count is always
  quite accurate); if stem:[S] is high, performance is excellent, but the
  global count lags (by at most the number of CPUs multiplied by stem:[S]).
* This accuracy/performance trade-off is what approximate counters enable.

'''

* A rough version of an approximate counter is found in Figure 29.4 (page 5).
* Read it, or better yet, run it yourself in some experiments to better
  understand how it works.

.Tip: More concurrency isn't necessarily faster
****
* If the scheme you design adds a lot of overhead (for example, by acquiring
  and releasing locks frequently, instead of once), the fact that it is more
  concurrent may not be important.
* Simple schemes tend to work well, especially if they use costly routines
  rarely.
* Adding more locks and complexity can be your downfall.
* All of that said, there is one way to really know: build both alternatives
  (simple but less concurrent, and complex but more concurrent) and measure
  how they do.
* In the end, you can't cheat on performance; your idea is either faster, or
  it isn't.
